        <p id="app-description">
            The idea behind the app was to create a great place to work on shaders, without the overhead (and chances of mistakes) that come from all the boilerplate that is usually required to see something on screen. Once they work, you can just use them on your app, knowing that if something is not working, at least the shaders are not the problem.
